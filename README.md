# Test Management

The subject of this project was to design and implement a web application to facilitate
the management of tests on the various products of the Maghreb Arab Press Agency (MAP)
and ensure traceability and the generation of test plans.
#
Its purpose is to enable users of the application, the testers of the management of
information systems within the MAP, to manage all projects and team members intervening,
scenarios, as well as the different test cases and their executions.
#
The application must also ensure the traceability of data as well as a system of Token
exchange and verification for security, ultimately generating detailed test plans.
Throughout the development phase, I have been confronted with delicate problems. 
#I have therefore multiplied my efforts to achieve this objective by respecting the time
constraint. This allowed me to put my knowledge effectively and in a more concrete way.
